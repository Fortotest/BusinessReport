## 1. Project Definition

### What is This Project?
This is more than just a dashboard; it's your interactive **business simulator**. üìà

This project is a web application designed as a strategic decision-making tool. Its goal is to assist business owners, marketers, and brands looking to grow within the Indonesian e-commerce market.

The application helps translate complex market data and various business assumptions into profit-and-loss simulations, financial projections, and clearer action plans.

> **Test your strategies, understand the market deeper, and design a solid plan before investing a large budget.**

### The Problem It Solves ü§î
The Indonesian e-commerce market is highly dynamic and competitive. Many businesses face challenges due to:
* Getting caught in tight price competition without calculating long-term profitability.
* Allocating marketing budgets (e.g., for KOLs or Ads) less efficiently.
* Difficulty staying informed about the latest market dynamics (like platform shifts).
* Finding it hard to accurately calculate crucial metrics like BEP, LTV, and ROAS.

### The Solution Provided ‚úÖ
This dashboard offers an integrated solution on a single page:
1.  **Providing Context:** Presents market intelligence data (GMV, consumer behavior, market share) so your decisions are based on relevant data.
2.  **Testing Assumptions:** Provides a series of dynamic calculators ("Strategy Lab") to instantly test each business assumption.
3.  **Simulating Outcomes:** Delivers financial projections (P&L, Cash Flow) and performance metrics (ROAS) in *real-time* based on the scenarios you create.
4.  **Giving Recommendations:** Generates sharp AI analysis and tactical action plans based on all the data you've inputted.
